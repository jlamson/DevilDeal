# Deal with the devil

I'm thinking of a castable curse. Like Momento from the Hermit.

The premise would be that it casts for cheap, but has an incredible effect (gain 3 mana this turn)

But then it'll add another copy to your deck like necronomicurse, to the point where you'll end up with a deck that produces bonkers energy but you can't draw your stuff
